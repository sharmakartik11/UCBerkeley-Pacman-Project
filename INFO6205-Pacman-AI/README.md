In searchAgents.py, you'll find a fully implemented SearchAgent, which plans out a path through Pac-Man's world and then executes that path step-by-step. The search algorithms for formulating a plan are not implemented -- that's your job. First, test that the SearchAgent is working correctly by running:

python pacman.py -l tinyMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=tinyMazeSearch
The command above tells the SearchAgent to use tinyMazeSearch as its search algorithm, which is implemented in search.py. Pac-Man should navigate the maze successfully.

Implement the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm in the depthFirstSearch function in search.py . To make your algorithm complete, write the graph search version of DFS, which avoids expanding any already visited states (R&N 3ed Section 3.3, Figure 3.7). Your code should quickly find a solution for:

python pacman.py -l tinyMaze -p SearchAgent
python pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent
python pacman.py -l bigMaze -z .5 -p SearchAgent

Implement the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm in the breadthFirstSearch function in search.py . Again, write a graph search algorithm that avoids expanding any already visited states. Test your code the same way you did for depth-first search.

python pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=bfs
python pacman.py -l bigMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=bfs -z .5

Implement A* graph search in the empty function aStarSearch in search.py . A* takes a heuristic function as an argument. Heuristics take two arguments: a state in the search problem (the main argument), and the problem itself (for reference information). The nullHeuristic heuristic function in search.py is a trivial example. You can test your A* implementation on the original problem of finding a path through a maze to a fixed position using the Manhattan distance heuristic (implemented already as manhattanHeuristic in searchAgents.py ).

python pacman.py -l bigMaze -z .5 -p SearchAgent -a fn=astar,heuristic=manhattanHeuristic 

Implement the CornersProblem search problem in searchAgents.py. That is, complete the missing part in the class CornersProblem to correctly represent the problem. You will need to choose a state representation that encodes all the information necessary to detect whether all four corners have been reached. Now, your search agent should solve:

python pacman.py -l tinyCorners -p SearchAgent -a fn=bfs,prob=CornersProblem
python pacman.py -l mediumCorners -p SearchAgent -a fn=bfs,prob=CornersProblem

Implement a heuristic for the CornersProblem in cornersHeuristic.

Grading: inadmissible heuristics will get no credit. 1 point for any admissible heuristic. 1 point for expanding fewer than 1600 nodes. 1 point for expanding fewer than 1200 nodes. Expand fewer than 800, and you're doing great!

python pacman.py -l mediumCorners -p SearchAgent -a fn=aStarSearch,prob=CornersProblem,heuristic=cornersHeuristic -z 0.5
